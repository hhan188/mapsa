### Practice 

1. Create a **Person** class with private fields name and age, and public getter and setter methods for each field. Then, create an instance of the Person class and set the values of the fields using the setter methods. Finally, print the values of the fields using the getter methods.
2. Create a BankAccount class with private fields accountNumber, balance, and interestRate, and public getter and setter methods for each field. The balance field should be of type double, while the other two fields should be of type int. Add a public method called deposit that takes a double parameter and adds it to the balance. Add a public method called withdraw that takes a double parameter and subtracts it from the balance. Make sure that the withdraw method checks that the balance is sufficient to cover the withdrawal amount, and throws an IllegalArgumentException if the balance is insufficient.
3. Create a Vehicle class with a private field maxSpeed and a public method startEngine that prints "Engine started". Then, create a Car class that extends Vehicle and adds a private field numberOfDoors. Add public getter and setter methods for numberOfDoors, and override the startEngine method to print "Car engine started". Finally, create an instance of Car and call the startEngine method to verify that it prints "Car engine started".
4. Create a Shape class with a private field color and a public method getColor that returns the value of color. Then, create a Circle class that extends Shape and adds a private field radius. Add public getter and setter methods for radius, and override the getColor method to print the color of the circle in addition to returning it. Finally, create an instance of Circle and call the getColor method to verify that it prints the color of the circle.
