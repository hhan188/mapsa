## Access modifiers

-------------------------------


Access modifiers in Java are keywords used to define the accessibility of 
classes, methods, and fields within a program.
There are four access modifiers in Java: public, protected, private, and default (also known as package-private).

Here's a brief explanation of each access modifier:

* public: A public class, method, or field can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including other packages.
* protected: A protected class, method, or field can only be accessed from within the same package or from a subclass in a different package.
* private: A private class, method, or field can only be accessed from within the same class.
* Default (package-private): A class, method, or field with no access modifier specified can only be accessed from within the same package.
