### practice 

---------------------------
1. Create a class Animal with a String field name and an int field age. Create a constructor that initializes these fields. Create a method speak that prints "I am an animal."
2. Create a class Dog that extends Animal. Add a String field breed and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a dog."
3. Create a class Cat that extends Animal. Add a boolean field isIndoor and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a cat."
4. Create a class Bird that extends Animal. Add a String field species and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a bird."
5. Create a class Zoo with a List of Animal objects. Add methods to add animals to the list, remove animals from the list, and print all animals in the list using their speak method. Use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class in each of the constructors of the child classes.
6. Create a class Fish that extends Animal. Add a String field waterType and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a fish."
7. Modify the Zoo class to handle Fish objects in addition to Animal objects. Add methods to add fish to the list, remove fish from the list, and print all fish in the list using their speak method.
8. Create a class Mammal that extends Animal. Add a boolean field isWarmBlooded and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a mammal."
9. Create a class Human that extends Mammal. Add a String field firstName, a String field lastName, and a constructor that initializes these fields. Override the speak method to print "My name is [first name] [last name]."
10. Create a class Student that extends Human. Add an int field gradeLevel and a constructor that initializes it. Override the speak method to print "I am a student in grade [grade level]." Use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class in each of the constructors of the child classes.
