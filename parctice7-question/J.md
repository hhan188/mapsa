1. Write a Java program that takes an integer as input from the user and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. Use the ternary operator to accomplish this task.
2. Write a Java program that takes three integer values as input from the user and determines which one is the largest. Use the ternary operator to accomplish this task.
3. Write a Java program that takes a string as input from the user and determines whether it contains the substring "hello". If it does contain the substring, the program should print "The string contains hello", otherwise it should print "The string does not contain hello". Use the ternary operator to accomplish this task.
