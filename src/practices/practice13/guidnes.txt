Implement the Seat and Theater classes using proper Java OOP principles, such as encapsulation and method design.
Use appropriate data structures, like arrays or lists, to manage the collection of seats in the theater.
Apply generics to make your code more flexible and reusable.
Handle exceptions gracefully by providing meaningful error messages to the user.
Use file reading and writing techniques to import and export the theater's seating arrangement from/to files.
Design a user-friendly command-line interface that guides users through various operations.
